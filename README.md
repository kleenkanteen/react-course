 This course taught me 5x more react than a 3rd year web dev course I took. The prof in the course was experienced and decent at teaching but was just too time constrained with the the limit of 24 lecture hours to teach all of web dev (html + css + django + react). That should've been a 2 semester long course. This youtube course I took on the other hand, top notch teaching. It being a youtube course is even nicer since you can rewind if you don't understand something, unlike live lectures. Pedro also has a gift for explaning things in a clear, concise manner. He's one of the best teachers I've ever learnt from.
